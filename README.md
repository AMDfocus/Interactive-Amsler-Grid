Interactive Amsler Grid for AMD Distortion Correction
This project is a web-based tool designed to help individuals with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) detect and correct visual distortions using an interactive Amsler grid. It allows users to mark perceived distortions, generate a personalized warp field, and preview corrected text overlays—all within a browser interface.

Features
📐 Interactive Calibration Grid: Users can click and drag on grid points to mark how they perceive visual distortion.

🔄 Real-Time Correction: Automatically generates a distortion map and applies it to text for clearer reading.

💾 Session Save & Restore: Save and load custom distortion data for consistent use.

📊 Error Metrics: View average, maximum, and significant distortion values.

🧠 Powered by ChatGPT: Several core algorithms and interface ideas were developed with the assistance of ChatGPT.

How to Use
Calibration: Use the grid to mark distorted points based on your perception.

Review: Compare the original and corrected output.

Adjust: Fine-tune warp strength or re-calibrate as needed.

Export: Save your session for future use or testing.

Technologies
HTML5 / CSS / JavaScript

Canvas API

FFT-based image warping (optional feature set)
